CAPEL ARTS & CRAFTS CLUBS FOR ALL AGES

Capel Art Group was founded on 2nd July 2002 with 10 members – this has now increased to 40 with a waiting list!

We meet every Tuesday and Wednesday from 9.30 a.m. to 12 noon in the Church Hall, Albany Road.

Once a month we tackle a nominated subject, where the remainder of the time we run as a workshop as we are all of differing abilities.

We all enjoyed a short painting break in Hon Fleur, France before preparing for our Annual Art Exhibition which was held on Saturday 28th May. in the Church Hall where priginal Art work was on sale,

We do feel that our relaxed and happy atmosphere is the key to our success……..

Capel Art Club members have enjoyed another full and busy year. Sadly we have lost another member very suddenly, Mick Santer. We visited Rochester Art and Craft Expo in April. This was fun. The Tuesday Group enjoyed another morning painting in Val and Keith’s garden. More delicious homemade scones and cakes. In May we hired a min-bus and visited Michele at her home in Polincove, where Michele and her Mother entertained us and we met French artists and painted together. Very enjoyable! 

Our annual holiday this year was to Co. Mayo, on the West Coast of Ireland. In spite of some predictions of rough crossings, the sun shone and the sea was gentle both ways. The Westport Hotel was excellent. People so friendly, youngsters polite and no graffiti anywhere. Sunshine everyday. The mountain ranges, swift flowing rivers and the coastal drive on Achille Island, all spectacular! Next year we are off to Cornwall. Lostwithiel based. Our Annual Art Exhibition was another huge success story. Folkestone Art on the railings on

The Leas organised by our Rosemary Dadson made a pleasant day out. Some members sold too. Peter Holden has won the Kent and Sussex Railway competition against fierce opposition. He has also sold at the Marwell Zoo Wildlife Exhibition, not one painting but two. St St Radigunds Art, Craft and Music weekend made us appreciate just how much talent there is in Capel. Next event will be our Christmas Buffet and Film Show of our Irish holiday, followed by a Christmas lunch at Little Farthingloe Farm Restaurant before we come to the end of a busy year. Thanks to all who have supported us!

We wish you all a Happy Christmas. Ahmed

A new art group

A new art group has started up in Capel on Friday evenings. 5pm till 7pm in the Church Hall, Albany Road. We need more members to enable us to have a very good teacher who would start in January.

At the moment we are helping each other with “constructive criticism” and encouragement and have one or two very good artists who help others. We use mainly oils, but watercolours and acrylics are also popular. If interested please ring Val Martin on 01303 894312 or 07968155441
