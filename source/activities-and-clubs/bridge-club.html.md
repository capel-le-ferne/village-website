title: Bridge Club

Classes are held at the Capel Village Hall every Tuesday afternoon between 3pm and 6pm.

The aim of the classes is to improve bidding and card play. Each week a different subject is covered where pre-set boards are played and then discussed. Although some of the topics may be new to you, the purpose is to make you aware of different conventions. Even though you may decide not to play these conventions, knowledge of them will certainly be of great use when opponents use them against you.

The classes are not suitable for those wishing to begin learning how to play Bridge – a basic knowledge of the game is required. However, whatever your skill level/experience everyone can benefit from the lessons whatever system you play.

A regular partner is not required as the lessons are designed to cater for individual players who may turn up.

Topics covered so far have included Stayman, Transfers, Blackwood (including RKC 0314), Finesses, Opening leads, Strong NT, Steps, Strong 2 Openings, Weak Twos, Splinters, Michaels Cue-bids, Unusual NT and Cue-bidding. Regular practice hand sessions are also held with the aim of re-inforcing the lesson content.

We don’t aim to change the way you were taught to play Bridge, but we do try to get you to ‘look outside the box’.
