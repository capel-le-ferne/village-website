1st YEAR ANNIVERSARY

Our first year has passed and we have had a great time. We would like to say a big thank you to all who have supported us. We, the leaders, would like to say a huge thanks to our Brownies who are a credit to us all and all the support from their families.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.

Anyone who has tried to join a local Brownie pack will know there is usually a long waiting list, now look no further as Capel-le-Ferne

has one of it’s own!

It is aimed at girls 7-10 years and we meet weekly for about an hour.

Every Tuesday, in term time, from 5.30pm – 7pm.
