ST. RADIGUNDS PLAYERS AND CHOIR

The St.Radigund Players were founded in 1999 at the instigation of the vicar, Gill Calver, to produce a pantomime to draw the Church closer to the Village.

Initially the cast was largely drawn from the Church and W.I but has now spread to include as wide a circle as possible of all ages.

Our first production was Aladdin and performed in the Primary School in March, 1999.

In 2000 we moved into the Village Hall with Pantomimes Dick Whittington and followed that with Jack and the Beanstalk and an Old Time Music Hall. 2004 and 2005 saw productions of Cinderella and Snow White, and an Old Time Music Hall in the Autumn. (See below for 2006 Pantomime Production)

The cast is mainly drawn from Capel and all ages are welcome to join. Children of primary age have most practices in school. Rehearsals for adults and secondary age children are held in St. Radigund’s Church and profits are distributed to village organizations.

Following discussions after the completion of Snow White, it is hoped to have a second performance of some sort in the Autumn each year and possibly a monthly club night for training, etc.

Anyone interested in taking part on stage -acting, singing, dancing, recitation, joining the choir or instrumental etc., please bring your ideas along to a meeting in St.Radigund’s Church or contact Colin Blake on 01303 241399.
