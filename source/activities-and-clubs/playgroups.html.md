CAPEL-LE-FERNE PRE-SCHOOL

A not for profit organisation serving the community since 1969

The pre-school meets in the village hall, and is run by a team of highly motivated, enthusiastic staff, to provide a fun-packed, but educational experience for children aged 2 to five years. We offer your child a safe and stimulating environment in which they can grow and blossom into self confident, self-reliant and positive little people in preparation for their big step up to primary education.

We are OFSTED registered and approved by KCC to offer free places to all eligible 3 and 4 year olds.

Capel-le-Ferne Pre-school is open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings, 0845 to 1230pm, term time only. £6.50 per session.

For more information telephone Alison on 07977 838609, or just pop along, during any session to have a look around and find out what we have to offer you and your child.
CASPER Nursery, Afterschool and Holiday Club

Casper is situated in the grounds of Capel-Le-Ferne Primary School, however the nursery is run independently, It was set up in January 2002, and since then has ran successfully. Casper would like to thank the local community for supporting the nursery throughout the past 4 years, as without your backing Casper wouldn’t be as popular as it is today. Due to the demand the Nursery, After school, Breakfast, and Holiday clubs all have extra spaces available as Ofsted has increased the registered number of children in the setting to 30.

The staff at Casper are always looking to monitor and improve the care they provide, and have been training to incorporate Ferre Laever methods of teaching. This provides a setting in which the children have independence and freedom of choice, however also understanding the importance of rules and boundaries.

At present Casper is working towards the Kite mark. This acts as a self assessment to help improve on the standards of care for the children.
