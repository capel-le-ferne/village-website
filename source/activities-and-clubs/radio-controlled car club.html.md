Capel Radio Controlled Car Club has a membership of approximately 20 members and meets every Friday at 7 to 10 p.m. at the Village Hall.

We race 10" Scale Electric Saloon Cars on carpet, running a full race programme each evening. The racing is controlled by a computer programme with fully automatic lap counting.

New members are always welcome.
