...to our friendly and busy village situated on the B2011, between Folkestone and Dover on the South East Coast of England. We do hope you will find something to interest you while browsing our site.

Why not have a day out in our village, especially on a Tuesday when you can visit our Farmers’ Market, have lunch in the Clifftop café or the Royal Oak or the Valiant Sailor pubs, then visit the Battle of Britain Memorial. and maybe take a stroll along our clifftop path (part of the North Downs Way) overlooking the English Channel and France?
